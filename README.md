# Right to be Offensive

Repository for the website hosted at https://righttobeoffensive.com/.

Built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).  Theme heavily based off [m10c](https://github.com/vaga/hugo-theme-m10c).

## Building

```shell
hugo
```

Requires an "extended" Hugo version.

## Deploying

```shell
cp -R public /srv/righttobeoffensive.com/src/public
```

Or something similar.  There's probably also something to do with sourcemaps but I don't quite understand that yet.

I don't know why I'm writing this bit.  Are you going to mirror my site?  That's weird.  Please tell me why.
